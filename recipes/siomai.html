    <h2>Panlasang Pinoy Recipe:</h2>
    <p>Siomai is a traditional Chinese dumpling. This popular dumpling has made its way to the heart of the Filipinoâ€™s as evidenced by the hundreds of stalls, eateries, and restaurants who serve them. Traditionally cooked through steaming, siomai nowadays are also served fried complimented with soy sauce and calamansi.</p>
    <p>In Manila, the best siomai can be found in the Manila China Town (which is the oldest China Town in the world). Several Chinese restaurants and even stalls serve different siomai varieties. Outside of China town, Pao Tsin would be the best one for me.</p>
